In case you are unable to run the below `gradle` commands, please check compatibility of the installed _JDK_ against that of _Gradle (8.8)_. You may have to lower your _JDK_ version to be compatible to that of _Gradle_ ([compatibility matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)).

Before executing the `gradlew` script, please make the script excutable:

Linux: `chmod +x gradlew`

### Building the project and running unit test

Run the following command to build the project and run the juint tests:

The unit tests are expected to fail (or even run forever) as is, due to missing implementations. 
**One of your objective is to ensure that the corresponding tests for your implementations pass**
Again, **Do not modify the provided unit tests..**
